This is a project to LEARN, not be given answers.

This is solely a personal project that could be used to put past projects on a pedestal for employers to see.

For now, nothing crazy. This can always be expanded upon in the future.

Let's list out some things that I would like to get out of everything.

THINGS TO LEARN:

1) Starting code
2) HTML
3) CSS
4) JavaScript
5) UI Design

More to be added, but let's begin!

I am using ChatGPT to guide me, but not to do things for me.
Maybe, ideally, I could use this to teach me, then I actually recreate a new portfolio website to test my knowledge. MMMMM

Okay to start, most web projects are set up with a index.html file, and things like assets, images, js, and css files.
